    <h2>Explanation</h2>

    <p>Django is a Python framework that simplifies web development by handling complex tasks for you. It follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle, promoting reusable components and making development faster. With built-in features like user authentication, database connections, and CRUD operations, Django lets you focus on building your web applications without reinventing the wheel.</p>
