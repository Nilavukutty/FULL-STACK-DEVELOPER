     <h2>Explanation</h2>

     <p>Spring is widely used for creating scalable applications. For web applications, Spring provides Spring MVC, a commonly used module for building robust web applications. The major drawback of traditional Spring projects is that configuration can be time-consuming and overwhelming for new developers. Making an application production-ready requires significant effort.

The solution to this is "Spring Boot". Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring Framework and includes all Spring features while simplifying configuration. It has become a developer favorite due to its rapid development capabilities, allowing developers to focus on business logic instead of struggling with configurations.

Spring Boot is a microservice-based framework that enables quick development of production-ready applications. A prerequisite for learning Spring Boot is a basic understanding of the Spring Framework.</p>
